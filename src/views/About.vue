                        I have extensive experience in aligning the gap between
                        technologies and business requirements. I have executed projects
                        throughout the entire software development life cycle to deliver
                        business focused solutions. I am a seasoned leader and technologist
                        specializing in conceptualizing, designing and implementing
                        innovative ideas into new products and strategies. I have
                        proficiency in API (REST and SOAP), Java, NodeJs and Angular. I
                        have extensively worked in messaging systems like Kafka and
                        ActiveMQ and container orchestration like Docker and Kubernetes
